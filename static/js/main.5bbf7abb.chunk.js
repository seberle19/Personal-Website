The book does, however, somewhat serve as a cautionary tale. One of Patterson's main points is that the stock market is not something that can predicted in the real world.

I have always felt that I wanted to know more about Greek Mythology but I never wanted to be burdened with having to struggle through a tough story like the Illiad. This book is perfect for anyone who would like to know about Mythology, but is okay with getting a cliff-notes version. Hamilton tells you all of the important parts of the stories without any of the clunky rhyming or extraneous details, that might be off putting. Hamilton also often creates a synthesis of one story from multiple different accounts to paint a more complete picture of the mythological tales.
